We designed the front-end and back-end based on this model. This project includes the front-end and back-end developed based on JavaScript. Please make sure that you have JavaScript-related components in your environment before use.





Please follow the steps below to start  
1. Unzip the file Wine predict; the file is a bit large; please be patient.  
2. Activate the backend  
  cd .\backend\
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    python app.py

3. Activate the frontend  
  cd .\frontend  
  npm install web-vitals  
  npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled  
  npm start  
4. Use the table as the real world example
